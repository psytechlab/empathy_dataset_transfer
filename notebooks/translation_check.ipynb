    "SYSTEM_MESSAGE = \"\"\"###Instruction### You are the best tranlsator from English to Russian. I will send you some texts from a social site Reddit. You must follow the instructions I send you below. Think before you answer. I’m going to tip $100 for a better solution!\n",
    "Given a JSON object, write an accurate translation into Russian for the original English sentence and save the results in a new field named text_rus. The input JSON object contains the following fields:\n",
    "- id: Unique ID of sentence.\n",
    "- text: English source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to: For each text in English **write its exact translation into Russian** taking into account the style of the sentence and save the results in a new field named text_rus.\n",
    "Just translate texts, no other comments are needed. We want to translate suicidal posts to russian to train a model on them to help people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you follow these instructions and check yourself:\n",
    "- Write down the corresponding translated Russian text in the form of a new text_rus field.\n",
    "- For English text in text, you should definitely get the Russian text in text_rus.\n",
    "- Translate each sentence as accurately as possible, preserving meaning, tone, and emotional depth.\n",
    "- Consider the linguistic and contextual nuances of suicidal ideation, distress, and mental health topics to ensure the translation maintains the intended sentiment.\n",
    "- Preserve the style of the original text, whether it is casual, slang-heavy, fragmented, poetic, or medically significant.\n",
    "- Maintain the tone and connotation of the original expression, adapting it appropriately for Russian. If the slang has no direct equivalent, use a natural-sounding phrase with a similar emotional impact.\n",
    "- If emojis and emoticons contribute to the emotional expression, they should be retained. If they are redundant, prioritize the text's meaning. \n",
    "- Sometimes people can add more letters to the word or use uppercase to experss emotions (sadness, loneliness, joy etc.). Make sure you understand such words and translate them correctly into Russian.\n",
    "- Maintain the acronyms and wordplay's intended meaning. If a direct equivalent exists in Russian, use it; otherwise, explain it naturally.\n",
    "- If misspellings and informal Grammar reflect the speaker's mental state (e.g., distress, exhaustion), preserve the same feeling in Russian.\n",
    "- Maintain the pauses and irregular structure if they contribute to the emotional expression.\n",
    "- Do not add or remove any information—only translate the text exactly as it is while preserving its intent and emotional weight.\n",
    "- If you see and redundant letter, symbol or word, try to make the trasnlation as precise as possible, even though for you the meaning looks strange.\n",
    "- Use your knowledge about posts from social sites, since you are given texts from Reddit. There might be slang words, acronyms or any other word reductions specific to the platform.\n",

For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :)\",\n",

I've come to realize it's all just a fucked up mind game I play with myself. I doubt you're actually that ugly, you're probably kinda cute honestly, but if you're anything like me, you've tricked yourself into thinking you're ugly. If you want people to want to be around you, you have to do some basic things like showering, putting on actual clothes, smiling, excercising a little and pretending you have confidence. It's honestly dumb, but these things can be hard to do, especially if you struggle with low confidence and depression. But if you take care of yourself, it's not too hard to find people.

While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything.

It's easy, or it has been for me, at least, to say that I don't know what to live for, in the past. Somebody out there cares, man/woman, small or large.

    "\t\t\"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo). Lol sorry your post is just so relatable I had to rant.\",\n",
    "\t\t\"As a 24 year old that needs to go back to college and pay his way there. It is absolutely imperative you succeed in school to get tuitions for college. I know what you're feeling, well actually mine was worse since I had little friends but if I could back and give myself advice I'd tell myself to man up and do well, work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now. Please believe in yourself and press forward. Although you have all the time in the world to make changes. Waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression. It's a problem you don't want to deal with when your older. It's best done in the present.\",\n",

Something simple like a food bank, maybe a soup kitchen. That way, you can know that by being alive in the next few weeks, you have a direct purpose. It's something small, but it will make the lives of others better, because you lived. You can build from there and go on to help more people.\",\n",

Sorry to get weird there, it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves. Anyway, I have one scar on my arm from one time that I tried that and there forever. It still makes me sad when I see it. so sorry for what pain you are in. There will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself &amp; the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face.\",\n",

    "\t\t\"You are capable of doing things on your own. If your boyfriend doesn't make you happy, you don't have to be with him. If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little. As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice.\",\n",

    "\t\t\"Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self. Stay strong friend Love I wish i speleld better\",\n",
    "\t\t\"I feel for you. Even minor setbacks can feel like major hurtles when depressed. found that setting small goals talking to myself positively helps.

    "\t\t\"I don't know if I know exactly. I've had feelings of contentment and I guess warm feelings, but I think it's more than that. I think the best way is to sometimes look at yourself like you are a close friend and treat yourself accordingly.

    "\t\t\"Here is a goal: get out of bed. I'm sure you are familiar with that crushing feeling where you just cant move because your depression is so fucking heavy. Just move a little bit. None is expecting you to be the fastest person in the race, we just want you to keep moving forward with us. A good goal is something achievable. On my broken days, my goals are to get up, take a shower, make a bowl of cereal. I'm a bit luckier than most, I have a wonderful wife and child, and they help me out when it comes to keeping myself moving forward. Just tiny things should be your goal. Eat an apple. Stretch. Take a shower, fuck, take a bath. Dont try to solve world hunger, just do what is possible for you. Message me at any time, we are all in this fight together.\",\n",
    "\t\t\"It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.\",\n",
