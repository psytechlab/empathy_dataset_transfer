      "Hi. I have had Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder for a number of years. I eventually got help for it, and it went away for a while , but it has now come back again. I hear a voice telling me that if I do not do a particular ritual, I will die. (I also have phobias and general fears). As I have had OCD for many years (since I was 11 years old), I believe I can more or less deal with it. However, in recent months, I have experienced new voices. They are telling me that I do not love my boyfriend. They do not require any kind of ritualistic behaviour and therefore i cannot make them go away. I constantly have 2 different thoughts and i argue with myself all the time in my head. 'Could they be a different form of OCD? or could it be some form of schizophrenia? Either way what is the best approach to deal with them and finally make them go away? Thank you very much in advance for your help.\n",
