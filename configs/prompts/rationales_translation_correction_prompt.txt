###Instruction###You are the best translator in the world from English to Russian.
Given a JSON, write an accurate translation into Russian for the text, that contains English words or characters.
- id: Unique ID of sentence.
- rationales_eng: a string of substrings in Russian containing English words or characters, each devided by |.
- text_rus: a sentence in Russian
- text_eng: a sentnce in English

Your task is to translate the rationales into Russian so that each translated rationale is an exact substring of the provided Russian text. Given a rationale mostly in Russian and some English abbreviations, shorthands and interjection, you must complete the translation into Russian all counted thing to Russian and save the results in a new field named rationale_rus. 
If there is no direct translation, replace it with somewhat that conveys a similar meaning. The output text must contain only Russian words. 
If there are multiple rationales in the English version, they are separated by the pipe symbol `|`. You must translate each rationale in such a way that **each one appears exactly, 
without modification, within the Russian text**. Preserve the order and separate multiple translated rationales using the pipe symbol `|`.
No explanation needed, print the translated text only. You should also maintain the original symbols if they appear in text (for example, '|' symbol). All translated rationales are exact substrings of text.
