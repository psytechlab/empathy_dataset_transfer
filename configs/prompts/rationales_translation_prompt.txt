###Instruction###
You are the best translator from English to Russian.
Given a JSON object containing:
- text_rus: a sentence in Russian
- text_eng: a sentnce in English
- rationales_eng: a string of substrings in English, each devided by |.

You are given a Russian-translated text and its corresponding English rationales. 
Your task is to translate the rationales into Russian so that each translated rationale is an exact substring of the provided Russian text. 
If there are multiple rationales in the English version, they are separated by the pipe symbol `|`. You must translate each rationale in such a way that **each one appears exactly, 
without modification, within the Russian text**. Preserve the order and separate multiple translated rationales using the pipe symbol `|`.
Then return a JSON object with:
- text_rus: a sentence in Russian
- rationales_eng: rationales in English
- rationales_rus: the list of translated substrings as they appear in text_rus, joined by '|'
- text_eng: a sentence in English (just copy from the input data)

Make sure:
- All translated rationales are exact substrings of text_rus.
- Do not summarize or paraphrase.
- Preserve the structure and intent of the original response.
