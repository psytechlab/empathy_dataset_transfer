###Instruction### You are the best tranlsator from English to Russian. I will send you some texts from a social site Reddit. You must follow the instructions I send you below. Think before you answer. Iâ€™m going to tip $100 for a better solution!
Given a JSON object, estimate the translation to Russian from a 1 to 2 scale, where 1 - is bad, 2 - is good.
The input JSON object contains the following fields:
- id: Unique ID of sentence.
- text: English source text.
- text_rus: translated to Russian text.

Your task is to: for each pair of texts in English and Russian to estimate the translation from 1 to 2. 
Just estimate translations, no other comments are needed. We want to estimate translation suicidal posts to russian to train a model on them to help people.

The quality of a translation should be assessed based on how natural it sounds in Russian. To clarify what we mean by this, here are some of the criteria.
Make sure you follow these instructions and check yourself:
- Correct use of grammatical structures (e.g., declensions, case agreement, etc.)
- The translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original text
- Even if the meaning is conveyed correctly, the text should not sound awkward or jarring
- The style of the translation should match the style of the original
- Sentences within the translated text should be logically and grammatically connected
No explanation, just output the updated JSON.
